## Gameplay
* Avoid the red snake that tries to eat you, and eat orange food to increase your score.
* The longer your body grows, the richer your colors become!


## Concept
*  Expanding upon the classic Snake game by introducing new mechanics:
  1. Two snakes: one controlled by the player, the other as a disruptive enemy
  2. A food chain mechanic: the player eats food, the enemy eats the player
  3. Several gameplay ideas were planned but not fully implemented
* Considerations around game balance
* Coding and deployment process
  

## Others
* Features not yet implemented:
  * Red snake's angry, hunt, and pause states
  * Speed-up and body-shrink modes

* Thoughts on balancing and introducing new features:
  * Guidance cues (e.g. the word "YOU")
  * Gradient effects and particle feedback when eating food
 
* Takeaways:
  * Got a better understanding of how to work with WebGL and Canvas
  * Learned how to break down ideas into smaller tasks and turn them into code
  * Went through the process of deploying a project with GitHub Pages
